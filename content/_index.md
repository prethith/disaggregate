I seek to understand the systems that structure our reality and I write to explore how those systems will shape the future. My aspiration is to guide humanity towards a world where work is optional and abundance is universal.

I'm a self-taught engineer, UC Davis dropout, ex-Procore IPO employee, and I founded Bradley Digital to help startups grow. Now, I'm looking for my next adventure.
